Look up personal icons (profile pictures) from a Unix file system!

Highly experimental library :)

## Set up instructions

To use this, see https://kinzler.com/picons/ftp/ for a repository of
icons which you can download to your `~/.picons` directory. The
structure should be:

* `.picons/`
   * `local/...`
   * `misc/...`
